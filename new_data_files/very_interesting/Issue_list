23X_1q21_recurrent_microduplication_r2cluster_1.cluster.txt
- path not split
23X_Angelman_r1cluster_3.cluster.txt
- missed dup-inv, we removed the preILP correct transition edge
23X_Xp11_22_Microduplication_r2cluster_8.cluster.txt
- same as above

23X_22q11-2_distal_deletion_r2cluster_7.txt
- why did we insert an inversion?
23X_15q26_overgrowth_r1cluster_14.cluster.txt
- Why did we introduce an inv, dummy wrong?
23Y_Potocki_Shaffer_r2cluster_6.cluster.txt
- Same as above
-- Looks like if event happened downstream, a random inv can appear upstream

23Y_2p15-16-1_microdeletion_r2cluster_3.cluster.txt
- extra split, need to find simpler cases to look into debugging
