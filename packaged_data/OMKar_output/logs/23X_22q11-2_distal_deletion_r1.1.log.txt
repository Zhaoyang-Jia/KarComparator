Continuous objective value is 0 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0003I 0 fixed, 1 tightened bounds, 0 strengthened rows, 0 substitutions
Cgl0004I processed model has 2 rows, 2 columns (2 integer (1 of which binary)) and 4 elements
Cutoff increment increased from 1e-05 to 960
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 0
Cbc0038I Cleaned solution of 0
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 2 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous of which 1 were internal integer and 0 internal continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.00 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 0 - took 0.00 seconds
Cbc0012I Integer solution of 0 found by feasibility pump after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 0, took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 0 to 0
Probing was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
